Data science project implementing dynamic pricing strategies for fitness classes
# Dynamic Pricing Strategies for Fitness Classes

## Project Overview
This project applies data science techniques to implement dynamic pricing strategies for fitness classes based on demand, time, and location.

## Key Components
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Price Elasticity Modeling
- Demand Forecasting
- Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how data-driven pricing can increase revenue per class, improve utilization, and support better business decision-making.
